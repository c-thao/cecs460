# TSI
This fourth project introduces the concept of a Technology Specific Instantiation (TSI). In this project instantiations of I/O buffers of the target technology, Spartan 6, were created in a separate TSI file removing the overhead introduced by allowing xilinx to compensate and create the I/O buffers itself.
