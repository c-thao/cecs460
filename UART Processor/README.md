# UART Processor
## Overview
This is a semester long project to create a full-duplex UART Processor that adheres to the specification of UART. The processor  handles serial communication and is compose of a transmit and receive engine. The processor will compliment the TramelBlaze, a 16 bit emulation of Xilinx's PicoBlaze designed and provided by John Tramel, as its form of serial communication via UART. Inside are the various project folders which contains the code files and testbenches for the projects from the initial project design leading into the final design.
