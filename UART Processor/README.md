# UART Processor
This is a semester long project to create a full-duplex UART Processor. The processor consists of a transmit engine and receive engine. Both were built separately and tested before full integration into the final UART Processor. Inside are various project folders which contains code files and testbenches for the project as it leads into the final design.
